Ruby Kata Save Princess

# Instructions
There are two variations for each kata. One with testing and one without the testing.

Copy and paste the version without testing in first. You will see that the kata was successfully answered in accordance hackerrank.com.

Copy and paste the version with testing to see the success messages in the result. I noticed that `return` causes issues for rendering the correct answer for the hackerrank.com page, but is needed for testing.
